How to build Dokan library


** Build Envrionment

You need WDK(Windows Driver Kit). You can get WDK through Microsoft Connect Web site for free.

https://connect.microsoft.com


** Build

When you unzip the dokan source codes, you can get the following folders.

    * \dokan (user-mode library dokan.dll)
    * \dokan_control (control program dokanctl.exe)
    * \dokan_mirror (sample program)
    * \dokan_mount (mount service mounter.exe)
    * \sys (driver dokan.sys) 

After installing WDK, launch the build environment from the Start menu. Change the directory to dokan source code.
Run Ågbuild /wcbgÅh command within each folders.


** Embed a manifest in programs

You may need to embed a manifest in dokanctrl.exe when you use Vista or Windows7. 
In that case, please run the following command within \dokan_mirror and \dokan_control directory.
"{PATH_TO_MT}\mt.exe" -manifest "dokanctl.exe.manifest"  -outputresource:"objchk_wlh_amd64\amd64\dokanctl.exe"
Please replace the target names besed on your environment.


** Install Driver

Now you can get binary programs for example under Åg\dokan\objchk_wlh_x86\i386Åç.
You need dokan.dll dokan.sys dokanctl.exe mounter.exe mirror.exe

Copy dokan.sys under \Windows\system32\drivers
Copy dokan.dll under \Windows\system32
Place dokanctl.exe and mounter.exe in the same folder.

Run Ågdokanctl.exe /i aÅh This means register the driver and the service to Windows.
You can also do them separately.
Ågdokanctl.exe /i dÅh Install driver.
Ågdokanctl.exe /i sÅh install service.

If you update your driver, you MUST restart your computer after uninstalling previous version.


** Test the driver

You can get version information when you run Ågdokanctl.exe /vÅh.


** Sample program

Run Ågmirror.exe /r c:\ /l mÅh. This means mirror C driver under M driver. Can you see M driver?
To unmount M driver, run Ågdokanctl.exe /u mÅh
You can see all options of mirror.exe by running mirror.exe without argument.


** Uninstall Driver

Ågdokanctl.exe /r aÅh Uninstall both driver and service.
Ågdokanctl.exe /r dÅh Uninstall driver.
Ågdokanctl.exe /r sÅh Uninstall service.
You should restart your computer after uninstalling driver.


** For Windows Vista x64

You are required a code signing certification to install driver on Windows Vista x64.
You can disable driver signature enforcement using ReadyDriver Plus.

** Network filesystem/provider support

Dokan supports network filesystem mode. You need dokan network provider dll in \dokan_np.
Please build it and copy dokannp.dll into Windows\system32 directly.
You need to register network provider dll to system : dokanctl.exe /i n 
(Unregister network provider : dokanctl.exe /r n) 
You probably need to restart your computer after register or unregister network provider.
And try "mirror.exe /r root_path /l drive_letter /n". 
/n option means to mount as network drive 
Network filesystem mode is an experimental implementation and not tested well. 


** Windbg

You can debug the driver with Windbg. http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/Devtools/Debugging/default.mspx
You need to turn debug mode on. http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/driver/tips/Debug_Vista.mspx
